Hello, I'm the founder of Ecchi Ocean, which undergoes name changes more
frequently than people argue over who is best girl in NGE. Also, I plan to stay
anonymous for the time being. I've been able to find people who are interested
in creating a hentai website with me by endlessly circlejerking about my plans
to create a hentai website to reep its profits and retire at the age of five.
What started as mindless circlejerk turned into an acutal project to undertake.

My plan for this website is to, in part, provide high quality video content to
/a/nons who desire it. This means the files served won't be compressed to the
ends of the earth. There will also be a large collection of image content to
enjoy too.

Also, in the future, I plan to offer a hentai ranking database and forum so
people will be able to rate and discuss their favorite lewd materials.

Did I mention that there will be a leaderboard? Yea, that'll be cool.

Anyways, I think that's enough for now. I'll update you all and give you some
screenshots of the site's design within sixy years time.
